# DevOps Take-Home Assessment

## Overview
You are tasked with containerizing the provided Flask application and setting up a complete CI/CD pipeline. This assessment evaluates your Docker, CI/CD, and bash scripting skills.

## Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- GitHub account with access to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
- Basic understanding of Flask applications

## Tasks

### 1. Containerization (40 points)

#### 1.1 Create Dockerfile
- Write a production-ready Dockerfile for the Flask application
- Use multi-stage builds to optimize image size
- Run the application as a non-root user for security
- Set appropriate environment variables
- Include health check configuration

#### 1.2 Docker Compose Setup
- Create a `docker-compose.yml` file that includes:
  - Flask application service
  - PostgreSQL database service
  - Proper networking between services
  - Volume persistence for database data
  - Environment variable configuration

#### 1.3 Environment Configuration
- Support for multiple environments (development, production)
- Use `.env` files for environment-specific settings
- Ensure sensitive data is handled securely

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline (35 points)

#### 2.1 GitHub Actions Workflow
Create a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that:
- Triggers on push to main branch and pull requests
- Runs tests (if any exist)
- Builds Docker image using multi-stage build
- Pushes image to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
- Uses semantic versioning for image tags
- Implements proper caching for faster builds

#### 2.2 Image Registry
- Configure authentication with GHCR
- Use appropriate image naming conventions
- Tag images with both commit SHA and semantic versions
- Ensure images are publicly accessible

### 3. Automation Scripts (15 points)

#### 3.1 Bash Scripts
Create the following bash scripts in a `scripts/` directory:

**`setup.sh`**
- Install dependencies and set up the development environment
- Initialize the database
- Create necessary directories and files

**`deploy.sh`**
- Deploy the application using Docker Compose
- Handle environment-specific configurations
- Include proper error handling and logging

**`cleanup.sh`**
- Clean up Docker containers, images, and volumes
- Provide options for selective cleanup
- Include safety checks

### 4. Documentation (10 points)

#### 4.1 Update README.md
- Clear setup and running instructions
- Prerequisites and dependencies
- Environment variable documentation
- Troubleshooting section

#### 4.2 Docker Documentation
- Document the Docker setup
- Explain the multi-stage build process
- Include examples of common Docker commands

## Evaluation Criteria
